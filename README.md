# Open cluster management - Search collector

The `search-collector` is part of the search component in Open Cluster Management. The [search feature spec](https://github.com/stolostron/search-v2-operator/wiki/Feature-Spec) has an overview of all the search components.

This process targets any kubernetes cluster to collect data about its configuration resources. Then this data is sent to the [search-indexer](https://github.com/stolostron/search-indexer), where it is inserted into a relational database.

## Data model

See the [Data model documentation](https://github.com/stolostron/search-collector/blob/main/pkg/transforms/README.md) for more information.

## Features

Search-collector provides a similar solution as Kubernetes controllers and consists of four main components.
 
* **Informer**: queries for resources and watches for updates
* **Transformer**: extracts data from resources to include in the search index and discovers relationships to other resources
* **Sender**: syncs state and sends changes to the search-indexer
* **Reconciler**: merges changes into search-collector internal state

## Usage and configuration

### Running Locally

> **Pre-requisite:** Go v1.18

1. Fetch Dependencies: `make deps`
    > **TIP 1:** You may need to install mercurial. `brew install mercurial`
    >
    > **TIP 2:** You may need to configure git to use SSH. Use the following command:
    >
    > `git config --global --add url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com/"`
2. Log into your development cluster with `oc login ...`.
    > **Alternative:** set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to some other kubernetes config file.
3. Run the program with `make run` or `go run main.go`

### Running on a cluster

- Pull image from Quay.io and deploy to your cluster.
- To test code changes, create a PR in this repo, the build process pushes the PR image to Quiay.io. From there you can pull it into your cluster.

### Environment Variables

Control the behavior of this service with these environment variables. For development these could be set on ./config.json

Name               | Required | Default Value            | Description
----               | -------- | -------------            | -----------
AGGREGATOR_URL     | yes      | <https://localhost:3010> | Deprecated. Use host + port instead.
AGGREGATOR_HOST    | yes      | <https://localhost>      | Location of the aggregator service.
AGGREGATOR_PORT    | yes      | 3010                     |
CLUSTER_NAME       | yes      | local-cluster            | Name of cluster where this collector is running.
HEARTBEAT_MS       | no       | 300000  // 5 min         | Interval(ms) to send empty payload to ensure connection
MAX_BACKOFF_MS     | no       | 600000  // 10 min        | Maximum backoff in ms to wait after send error
REDISCOVER_RATE_MS | no       | 120000  // 2 min         | Interval(ms) to poll for changes to CRDs
REPORT_RATE_MS     | no       | 5000    // 5 seconds     | Interval(ms) to queue changes before sending to the aggregator
RUNTIME_MODE       | no       | production               | Running mode (development or production)

### Other Configuration Options

- Environment variables can also be set in the `./config.json` for development. If both provide a value for a specific property, the environment variable overrides the file. You can define your own `config.json` file and pass it to the application with the following command: `-c <config_file>`
- The application can take any flags for [glog](https://github.com/golang/glog), which passes them straight into glog. The glog flag `--logtostderr` is set to true by default.

### Dev Preview (Search Configurable Collection)

Configurable collection is now fully supported. This topic has moved [here](https://github.com/stolostron/search-v2-operator/wiki/Search-Configurable-Collection).

### Contribution

When you make contributions to this project, fork the project then merge your changes by creating a pull request from your personal fork to the main project:

1. Fork the `search-collector` repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Set upstream origin with the following command: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:stolostron/search-collector.git`
4. Make your edits. Test locally with `make test` before creating a pull request to ensure smooth merging :smile:
5. Push your new commits to your personal fork with the following command: `git push origin`
6. Create a pull request from your personal fork again the upstream `search-collector` main branch
